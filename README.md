## Project description

***Overview:*** \
This project is dedicated to the development of an Automatic Sign Language Translation system, with a specific focus on translating Nigerian Sign Language (NSL) into one of the Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) spoken in Nigeria. The primary objective is to address the communication challenges faced by the NSL community and contribute to inclusivity and employment opportunities in education and the workforce.

***Significance:*** \
Effective communication is a cornerstone of societal cohesion, and this project addresses a critical gap in the integration of the NSL community into the broader society. Sign language, while vital for the hearing-impaired, often faces limitations in bridging the gap with the larger community. This project seeks to overcome these limitations and promote a more inclusive and understanding society.

***Potential Applications:***

- ***Education***:
  - Integration into schools and educational institutions to support hearing-impaired students.
  - Facilitation of communication in educational settings, creating a more inclusive learning environment.
- ***Workforce:***
  - Facilitating communication in the workplace, creating job opportunities for NSL speakers.
  - Promotion of diversity and inclusion in professional environments.
- ***Community Involvement:***
  - Empowering NSL speakers to engage more actively in community activities.
  - Bridging the gap between the NSL community and the broader society.
