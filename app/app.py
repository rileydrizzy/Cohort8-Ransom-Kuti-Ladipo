NSL-2-AUDIO Web Application

This module contains the main code for the NSL-2-AUDIO web application, \
an open-source Automatic Sign Language Translation system designed to \
translate Nigerian Sign Language (NSL) into Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) spoken in Nigeria.

Features:
- Integration with Streamlit for the user interface.
- Utilizes Lottie animations for visual enhancements.

Usage:
Run this module to launch the NSL-2-AUDIO application.

Dependencies:
- streamlit
- streamlit-lottie

Example:
    $ python -m streamlit run app.py
